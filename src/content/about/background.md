title: About
---

I'm a software engineer with 10 years of experience across diverse sectors and roles. My career has evolved into a senior tech lead role where the projects I'm responsible for delivering are shaping the direction of the organisation. While I excel at leading technical projects and acting as a bridge between my engineering team and senior leadershipâ€”my true passion lies in writing code, obsessing over design details and shipping features.
