Started several years ago as a friendly competition among friends to bet on winners of major golf tournaments. It's evolved from a simple spreadsheet into an over-engineered web application. I've rewritten it many times as a playground to test out new technologies so it may be in a WIP state depending on the time. Most recently I've swapped out GraphQL for tRPC.
