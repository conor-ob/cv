The first side project I worked on which I got into a finished enough state to publish on the Google Play Store. At its peak it had around 5,000 users and was often mistaken for the official Dublin Bus app. I eventually shut it down when I couldn't keep up with the amount of breaking changes Dublin Bus kept making to their API.
